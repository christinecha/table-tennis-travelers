    notes:
      "Korea is such a wonderful country for table tennis. Each neighborhood seems to have at least one club, kept perfectly spotless with high quality equipment and etiquette no matter the level of play. \n\nHai Table Tennis Room is really that - just a room - but there is enough space to practice and play matches. Most walk-ins seem to be for casual dates or leisure, although we did get one random chopper (pictured) who gave Felipe a run for his money! \n\nOverall a really pleasant experience if you want to play ping pong in the Hongdae neighborhood of Seoul.",
