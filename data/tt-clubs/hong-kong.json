    "notes": "26 table tennis tables, spread across 3 giant floors. Welcome to Hong Kong's largest table tennis club!\n\nFlooring, lighting, and space were all excellent. The tables were also high quality even though some of them were a bit beat up. We walked in and rented a table on the spot (you can't do it over the phone without a Hong Kong resident card) - but it's probably better if you try to book ahead of time to guarantee space.\n\nEveryone was very nice to us, even though we spoke zero Cantonese, but it seems they were mostly grouped up already with playing partners, as opposed to totally open play. For a total of 21HKD per hour, this is a dream.",
