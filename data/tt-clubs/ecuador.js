      "We stumbled upon this tiny little bar on our way to Las Grietas, a natural swimming basin in the Galapagos Islands. As you can tell from the photo, we were not expecting to play, but couldn't miss out on the chance.\n\nThere's one table in this place, questionable quality and space, but it was definitely worth a stop and a drink - shoddy hardbat rackets, wetsuits, and all!",
