    "notes": "You know you're addicted to table tennis when you travel 1-hour each way (from Zurich airport) to play during a layover... at 7 in the morning. \n\nThis place is not a table tennis club alone, but a multi-sports complex. If you book a table, you'll be placed in a squash room, which is actually perfect because you spend less time chasing the ball.\n\nNice space, super clean. We walked from the train station with our baggage which was a tiny bit scary (not a good pedestrian area) but it wasn't far.\n\nEverything is quite expensive in Switzerland, so at 25 Swiss Francs for an hour of play (per table, so ~$13 USD per person), we've got a pretty good deal.",
