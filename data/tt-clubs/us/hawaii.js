    notes:
      "We made it to Honolulu! This club was a bit tricky to find - it's located on the second floor in the back of a mixed use building. There are signs hanging on the walkway above the hardware store, visible from the parking lot. Check out Bob's BBQ across the street for a quick bite before practice.\n\nEveryone at the club was cheerful and welcoming (as Hawaiians tend to be!). We played some singles as well as a round of 44mm-short-pips doubles (yikes) with the local players, who seemed to mostly range from beginner to ~2000 USATT, depending on the day. \n\nThere's no AC, so bring a towel! There is a fridge full of cold beverages and free snacks, though. The flooring was great, ceiling height was acceptable, space was good, tables were high quality. They seem to have an active league with solid attendance as well.\n\nMahalo especially to Billy and Diane for making us feel at home. Hopefully next time we can stay a bit longer... and until next time, aloha!",
