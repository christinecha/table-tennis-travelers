    notes:
      "Located at Lucky Shoals Park, AGTTA boasts a huge space, lots of natural light, and ultra high ceilings. The flooring is regular gym flooring, so not ideal, but not bad either. It's not a permanent club - it's only set up there on Sundays and Tuesdays - but it seems to have a strong regular community nonetheless.\n\nThe level is mostly beginner to intermediate. Great competition for someone around a 1300 USATT level, but maybe not challenging enough for a more advanced (1800+) player. They do make it very easy to hop in the rotation of gameplay, so don't worry about showing up solo.\n\nFriendly crowd, free coaching on Sundays, and lots of tables.\n\n$5 day pass for non members.",
