    notes:
      "Players beware: this is one of the most underrated clubs in the country! This club is notorious for having a majority of their players underrated by 100+ points compared to national averages, so don't underestimate your opponents here. ðŸ˜…\n\nAll joking aside, the Alameda club seems to have a very strong sense of community. Actively invested players, a lot of purposeful inclusion, and very good league attendance. \n\nTables, space, and lighting are great, flooring could be better but isn't bad, and they have a monthly membership option for $50. A very solid club right outside San Francisco.",
