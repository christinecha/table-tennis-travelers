      "Players beware: this is one of the most underrated clubs in the country! This club is notorious for having a majority of their players underrated by 100+ points compared to national averages, so don't underestimate your opponents here. ðŸ˜…\n\nAll joking aside, the Alameda club seems to have a very strong sense of community. Actively invested players, a lot of purposeful inclusion, and very good league attendance. \n\nTables, space, and lighting are great, flooring could be better but isn't bad, and they have a monthly membership option for $50. A very solid club right outside San Francisco.",

      "While it's not a permanently open location, Sunset Table Tennis Club is a great spot to play a few easy minutes' walk from the Glen Park BART Station. Check the website to make sure it's open before you go - hours and days can be variable since it's in a school gymnasium. \n\nTables are decent quality, there's a lot of space to play, and they even set up a robot on one table if you want. Flooring is a bit slippery (as with most gymnasiums) so maybe not the best place for footwork drills.\n\n$8 per person for open play, with different options for coaching and leagues.",

      "Some of the best players in all of the US train at this club. That's probably somewhat due to geographic location, but regardless, it's just a very professional atmosphere. We definitely recognized some faces from the USATT top 25 list.\n\nThe front tables are reserved for training professionals and coaching. There is a back table for coaching lower-level players as well, and two rooms even further back for more casual play. All the other tables are first-come, first-serve, with challenges welcome.\n\nThe flooring, space, lighting, and tables were all fantastic. The only complaint we had was that there didn't seem to be a working drinks machine or water fountain, so bring your own bottle.\n\nThe last thing that makes this club extra special is that it's a non-profit, so entrance is donation based (suggestion of $10).",

      "This SPiN location is gorgeous. It's one of the few that are ground-level, with floor-to-ceiling windows flooding the place with sunlight. There is so much space, in all directions! \n\nIt's quite empty during the day since they haven't (yet) developed a serious group of regulars, so it's easy to pop in and get a table.\n\nThe only thing lacking here is access to high-level players; it doesn't boast a pro coaching staff like the NY 23 spot.",
