      "Players beware: this is one of the most underrated clubs in the country! This club is notorious for having a majority of their players underrated by 100+ points compared to national averages, so don't underestimate your opponents here. ðŸ˜…\n\nAll joking aside, the Alameda club seems to have a very strong sense of community. Actively invested players, a lot of purposeful inclusion, and very good league attendance. \n\nTables, space, and lighting are great, flooring could be better but isn't bad, and they have a monthly membership option for $50. A very solid club right outside San Francisco.",

      "While it's not a permanently open location, Sunset Table Tennis Club is a great spot to play a few easy minutes' walk from the Glen Park BART Station. Check the website to make sure it's open before you go - hours and days can be variable since it's in a school gymnasium. \n\nTables are decent quality, there's a lot of space to play, and they even set up a robot on one table if you want. Flooring is a bit slippery (as with most gymnasiums) so maybe not the best place for footwork drills.\n\n$8 per person for open play, with different options for coaching and leagues.",

    notes:
      "Some of the best players in all of the US train at this club. That's probably somewhat due to geographic location, but regardless, it's just a very professional atmosphere. We definitely recognized some faces from the USATT top 25 list.\n\nThe front tables are reserved for training professionals and coaching. There is a back table for coaching lower-level players as well, and two rooms even further back for more casual play. All the other tables are first-come, first-serve, with challenges welcome.\n\nThe flooring, space, lighting, and tables were all fantastic. The only complaint we had was that there didn't seem to be a working drinks machine or water fountain, so bring your own bottle.\n\nThe last thing that makes this club extra special is that it's a non-profit, so entrance is donation based (suggestion of $10).",

      "This SPiN location is gorgeous. It's one of the few that are ground-level, with floor-to-ceiling windows flooding the place with sunlight. There is so much space, in all directions! \n\nIt's quite empty during the day since they haven't (yet) developed a serious group of regulars, so it's easy to pop in and get a table.\n\nThe only thing lacking here is access to high-level players; it doesn't boast a pro coaching staff like the NY 23 spot.",
