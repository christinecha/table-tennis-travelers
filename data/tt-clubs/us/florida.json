    "notes": "Bienvenidos a Miami! Well, not quite. Nestled away in Broward county, this south Florida club boasts several full professional courts with glass partitions, rubberized flooring, excellent lighting, and of course, much needed air conditioning. The high humidity made adjusting to the conditions a challenge for us, but we were able to slow down and get the hang of it by the end of our time here.\n\nWe really enjoyed training with Lady Ruano and playing some practice matches with the local league players. Chu was perhaps the most impressive of them, having won several of the Friday night handicap tournaments in a row.\n\nStaying by the beach in Fort Lauderdale was slightly inconvenient in terms of logistics, so if you plan to visit this club we would suggest finding a place a little closer to the club itself. Broward TTC also runs regular tournaments with great prizes, making this one of the most attractive clubs on the east coast for any table tennis aficionados.\n\nOverall, five stars -- we highly recommend checking this place out, and plan to win the U3400 doubles tournament the next time we're in town!",
