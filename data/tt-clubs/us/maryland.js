    notes:
      "Drivers, be warned - this club is pretty hard to find! It's located inside a mixed-use complex, so you have to keep an eye out for these tiny brown signs to lead you into the correct parking lot.\n\nMDTTC is a high quality training center. There are a lot of tables and a good amount of space at each one. In the few hours we spent there, we saw kids training, professional coaching, intermediate amateurs - the whole spectrum of table tennis levels. \n\nThere are two league nights - over 1000 and over 1800 - each weekend. We didn't get to play those, but it seems that there's usually a pretty solid showing. Maybe next time!",
