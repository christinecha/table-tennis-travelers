      "Drivers, be warned - this club is pretty hard to find! It's located inside a mixed-use complex, so you have to keep an eye out for these tiny brown signs to lead you into the correct parking lot.\n\nMDTTC is a high quality training center. There are a lot of tables and a good amount of space at each one. In the few hours we spent there, we saw kids training, professional coaching, intermediate amateurs - the whole spectrum of table tennis levels. \n\nThere are two league nights - over 1000 and over 1800 - each weekend. We didn't get to play those, but it seems that there's usually a pretty solid showing. Maybe next time!",

Check the website to make sure it's open before you go - hours and days can be variable since it's in a school gymnasium. \n\nTables are decent quality, there's a lot of space to play, and they even set up a robot on one table if you want. Flooring is a bit slippery (as with most gymnasiums) so maybe not the best place for footwork drills.\n\n$8 per person for open play, with different options for coaching and leagues.",

We definitely recognized some faces from the USATT top 25 list.\n\nThe front tables are reserved for training professionals and coaching. There is a back table for coaching lower-level players as well, and two rooms even further back for more casual play. All the other tables are first-come, first-serve, with challenges welcome.\n\nThe flooring, space, lighting, and tables were all fantastic. The only complaint we had was that there didn't seem to be a working drinks machine or water fountain, so bring your own bottle.\n\nThe last thing that makes this club extra special is that it's a non-profit, so entrance is donation based (suggestion of $10).",

Downstairs, although recently redone, is not quite as nice but gives you some overflow room.\n\nGood coaches, competitive players, and an overall high level of seriousness.\n\n$8 per hour, $15 for a day pass.",
