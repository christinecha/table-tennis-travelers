      "NYTT has to be the most Korean club in New York. (For context, every club in Korea we've seen has those signature mini umpire chairs with scoreboards at each table!)\n\nThe've got one pong robot booth and a designated coaching area outfitted with ball-catching nets. Some very high level players supposedly frequent this club, but most of the regulars seem to be about an intermediate amateur level.\n\nPeople seemed open to playing matches - singles or doubles - as well as just training. The floors are a tad slippery and the space is a bit tight, but if you aren't planning to lob, it's probably fine.\n\nWe'll be back!",
