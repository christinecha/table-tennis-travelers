      "NYTT has to be the most Korean club in New York. (For context, every club in Korea we've seen has those signature mini umpire chairs with scoreboards at each table!)\n\nThe've got one pong robot booth and a designated coaching area outfitted with ball-catching nets. Some very high level players supposedly frequent this club, but most of the regulars seem to be about an intermediate amateur level.\n\nPeople seemed open to playing matches - singles or doubles - as well as just training. The floors are a tad slippery and the space is a bit tight, but if you aren't planning to lob, it's probably fine.\n\nWe'll be back!",

      "If you're on the Upper West Side (UWS), Wang Chen's is probably your best bet for table tennis. It's two floors. Upstairs has better conditions but quickly gets full during peak hours, since there's only 3 tables. The flooring is decent, the ceiling height is OK, but the space around the table is a bit cramped. Downstairs, although recently redone, is not quite as nice but gives you some overflow room.\n\nGood coaches, competitive players, and an overall high level of seriousness.\n\n$8 per hour, $15 for a day pass.",
