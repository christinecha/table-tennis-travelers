Actively invested players, a lot of purposeful inclusion, and very good league attendance. \n\nTables, space, and lighting are great, flooring could be better but isn't bad, and they have a monthly membership option for $50. A very solid club right outside San Francisco.",

      "We made it to Honolulu! This club was a bit tricky to find - it's located on the second floor in the back of a mixed use building. There are signs hanging on the walkway above the hardware store, visible from the parking lot. Check out Bob's BBQ across the street for a quick bite before practice.\n\nEveryone at the club was cheerful and welcoming (as Hawaiians tend to be!). We played some singles as well as a round of 44mm-short-pips doubles (yikes) with the local players, who seemed to mostly range from beginner to ~2000 USATT, depending on the day. \n\nThere's no AC, so bring a towel! There is a fridge full of cold beverages and free snacks, though. The flooring was great, ceiling height was acceptable, space was good, tables were high quality. They seem to have an active league with solid attendance as well.\n\nMahalo especially to Billy and Diane for making us feel at home. Hopefully next time we can stay a bit longer... and until next time, aloha!",

      "Don't be fooled by the name; this club is definitely not located in Tribeca. You can find it just a few blocks off the Main Street Flushing stop (last stop on the 7 Train) on 37th Avenue, just through the parking lot and to the left.\n\nThis is probably one of the best places to play in the five boroughs of NYC in terms of actual seriousness, conditions, and resources. \n\nThe first floor has 8 or 9 tables, depending on the day, and the mezzanine has another 3. They're all in pretty decent shape and the space is definitely more than enough for the average amateur player. (If you're a lobber, though, you might feel a bit restricted on the ceiling height!)\n\nRobert Chen is the owner of this club, and he's a hoot. Always cracking jokes, happy to hit with anyone for a bit, and a solid coach. (He's maybe a bit too competitive when it comes to doubles, but maybe that's just when we're playing.)\n\n$10 day pass, and close to so much great food - best way to spend a Saturday in Flushing.",

It's not a permanent club - it's only set up there on Sundays and Tuesdays - but it seems to have a strong regular community nonetheless.\n\nThe level is mostly beginner to intermediate. Great competition for someone around a 1300 USATT level, but maybe not challenging enough for a more advanced (1800+) player. They do make it very easy to hop in the rotation of gameplay, so don't worry about showing up solo.\n\nFriendly crowd, free coaching on Sundays, and lots of tables.\n\n$5 day pass for non members.",

Solid level of competitive play, and a good variety of styles. Mostly good flooring, although the humidity can make the area around the back few tables really slippery.\n\nThe players were quite friendly - pictured here is Felipe with our new friend, Tom (on the right) - and we felt pretty welcome. They have League Night every Saturday, except the few weekends when there's a big USATT tournament in the area, and you'll often spot the fierce young players doing their multi-ball training in the front.\n\nWe'll be back!",

      "If you love table tennis, you might have heard of legendary German player Timo Boll. And if you love Timo Boll, you might want to check this place out.\n\nBorussa D√ºsseldorf is the training center for some of the best international players. It's not one portion of a large sports venue - it IS the sports venue. Beautiful halls, world class equipment, cross-training gyms, sports hotel - this is as good as it gets.\n\nThe good news is, you don't have to be Timo to play here. Through a program called Andro TT Schule, you can drop in for a short, intensive training for amateur players. We enrolled in the 4-day schedule, which costs about $300 USD per person. There was about 5 hours of training each day, ranging from match drills to footwork exercises to video analysis.\n\nThe group had a big range of levels, from beginner to advanced, with most people landing around the 1600-1700 USATT level (from what we could tell). In our session, there were only a few players that looked more advanced (2000 - 2200 USATT), and no one above that.\n\nThe attached Sports Hotel was super clean. No frills, but had everything you needed, including this lovely photo of young J√∂rg Ro√ükopf and Vladimir Samsonov looking down on you to keep you motivated.\n\nHighly recommend, and will definitely be back.",

      "Bienvenidos a Miami! Well, not quite. Nestled away in Broward county, this south Florida club boasts several full professional courts with glass partitions, rubberized flooring, excellent lighting, and of course, much needed air conditioning. The high humidity made adjusting to the conditions a challenge for us, but we were able to slow down and get the hang of it by the end of our time here.\n\nWe really enjoyed training with Lady Ruano and playing some practice matches with the local league players. Chu was perhaps the most impressive of them, having won several of the Friday night handicap tournaments in a row.\n\nStaying by the beach in Fort Lauderdale was slightly inconvenient in terms of logistics, so if you plan to visit this club we would suggest finding a place a little closer to the club itself. Broward TTC also runs regular tournaments with great prizes, making this one of the most attractive clubs on the east coast for any table tennis aficionados.\n\nOverall, five stars -- we highly recommend checking this place out, and plan to win the U3400 doubles tournament the next time we're in town!",

He and everyone else at the club were all very friendly even though we spoke zero Vietnamese (sorry!), which made it even better.\n\nThe humidity in south Vietnam made the ball so slow that it took us a few days to adjust! But that's not unique to this club.\n\nYou won't find this club on Google Maps, so here's the address. It's inside of what looks to be a public school, so just wander in past the gate.\n\nIt costs about 25,000 VND (~$1 USD) to play there, which is absolutely bonkers.",

      "26 table tennis tables, spread across 3 giant floors. Welcome to Hong Kong's largest table tennis club!\n\nFlooring, lighting, and space were all excellent. The tables were also high quality even though some of them were a bit beat up. We walked in and rented a table on the spot (you can't do it over the phone without a Hong Kong resident card) - but it's probably better if you try to book ahead of time to guarantee space.\n\nEveryone was very nice to us, even though we spoke zero Cantonese, but it seems they were mostly grouped up already with playing partners, as opposed to totally open play. For a total of 21HKD per hour, this is a dream.",

Most walk-ins seem to be for casual dates or leisure, although we did get one random chopper (pictured) who gave Felipe a run for his money! \n\nOverall a really pleasant experience if you want to play ping pong in the Hongdae neighborhood of Seoul.",

There are a lot of tables and a good amount of space at each one. In the few hours we spent there, we saw kids training, professional coaching, intermediate amateurs - the whole spectrum of table tennis levels. \n\nThere are two league nights - over 1000 and over 1800 - each weekend. We didn't get to play those, but it seems that there's usually a pretty solid showing. Maybe next time!",

      "You know you're addicted to table tennis when you travel 1-hour each way (from Zurich airport) to play during a layover... at 7 in the morning. \n\nThis place is not a table tennis club alone, but a multi-sports complex. If you book a table, you'll be placed in a squash room, which is actually perfect because you spend less time chasing the ball.\n\nNice space, super clean. We walked from the train station with our baggage which was a tiny bit scary (not a good pedestrian area) but it wasn't far.\n\nEverything is quite expensive in Switzerland, so at 25 Swiss Francs for an hour of play (per table, so ~$13 USD per person), we've got a pretty good deal.",

There is so much space, in all directions! \n\nIt's quite empty during the day since they haven't (yet) developed a serious group of regulars, so it's easy to pop in and get a table.\n\nThe only thing lacking here is access to high-level players; it doesn't boast a pro coaching staff like the NY 23 spot.",

Check the website to make sure it's open before you go - hours and days can be variable since it's in a school gymnasium. \n\nTables are decent quality, there's a lot of space to play, and they even set up a robot on one table if you want. Flooring is a bit slippery (as with most gymnasiums) so maybe not the best place for footwork drills.\n\n$8 per person for open play, with different options for coaching and leagues.",

      "Some of the best players in all of the US train at this club. That's probably somewhat due to geographic location, but regardless, it's just a very professional atmosphere. We definitely recognized some faces from the USATT top 25 list.\n\nThe front tables are reserved for training professionals and coaching. There is a back table for coaching lower-level players as well, and two rooms even further back for more casual play. All the other tables are first-come, first-serve, with challenges welcome.\n\nThe flooring, space, lighting, and tables were all fantastic. The only complaint we had was that there didn't seem to be a working drinks machine or water fountain, so bring your own bottle.\n\nThe last thing that makes this club extra special is that it's a non-profit, so entrance is donation based (suggestion of $10).",

Upstairs has better conditions but quickly gets full during peak hours, since there's only 3 tables. The flooring is decent, the ceiling height is OK, but the space around the table is a bit cramped. Downstairs, although recently redone, is not quite as nice but gives you some overflow room.\n\nGood coaches, competitive players, and an overall high level of seriousness.\n\n$8 per hour, $15 for a day pass.",
